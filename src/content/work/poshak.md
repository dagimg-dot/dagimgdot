Poshak Consultancy Services is a specialized IT consultancy firm focused on developing tailored ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems for garment factories in Ethiopia and India. During my tenure, I worked on fixing bugs in a mobile app, which helped streamline the release process, ensuring adherence to project deadlines. Additionally, I contributed to enhancing user experience by addressing critical issues in the mobile app prior to its launch and worked specifically on a key mobile application for inventory management, collaborating with designers to improve the user interface and overall experience.
