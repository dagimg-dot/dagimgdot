CodeLight Software Engineering is a rapidly expanding provider of innovative software solutions in Ethiopia, recognized for delivering impactful projects for major organizations like Ethio Telecom and leading insurance companies. During my time there, I designed and implemented a user-friendly dashboard for system administrators, enhancing access to customer data and policy details. Additionally, I developed a task automation script using TypeScript that streamlined data migration processes between databases, reducing manual input errors and improving overall efficiency.
