Vicinae Gnome Extension is a GNOME Shell extension that supercharges your Vicinae launcher experience.

### Why Vicinae Gnome Extension?

There is a new launcher in town for Linux with raycast store compatibility and it fully works on Gnome. Well it didn't at first and then I came in 😁

The Vicinae launcher needed proper GNOME integration to work seamlessly on the desktop environment. I built this GNOME extension to expose clipboard and window management APIs to the C++ backend, making Vicinae fully functional on GNOME.

The extension is now at 160+ downloads on GitHub and has become an essential component for Vicinae users on GNOME! 🧨

### Key Features

📋 **Seamlessly expose clipboard events** through DBus  
🖼️ **Powerful window management APIs** via DBus  
🔒 **Protect sensitive apps** (like password managers) by blocking clipboard access  
🪟 **Smart launcher window** that mimics layer-shell protocol: auto-centers, stays on top, and gracefully closes when you click away
