Contextify is a mini Gemini AI wrapper that allows you to search for meaning of words without losing the context with minimal effort!

### Why ?

Traditional dictionaries often fall short. They provide definitions and basic examples, but they lack the nuanced understanding of how words are used in specific contexts. This gap can leave us struggling to fully grasp and confidently use new vocabulary.

### Why Contextify ?

You might be wondering, "Why not just use ChatGPT or another AI model?" Great question! This app also uses one of these LLMs called Gemini (from Google) but While those tools are incredibly powerful, they can sometimes be overwhelming or time-consuming for quick word lookups. Contextify is designed for those moments when you just need a fast, focused explanation without leaving your reading environment.

### Key Features

- **PWA Support**: Contextify is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it can be installed on your device and used as a standalone application.

- **Effortless Selection**: Simply highlight the word you're unsure about within its sentence and hit send.

- **Focused Functionality**: Contextify isn't trying to be an all-in-one language tool. It's purposely simple and easy to use.

- **Flexible Prompts**: Switch between "Default" (for new words) and "Blank" (for follow-up questions) seamlessly.

- **Conversation Management**: Save conversations and start new ones, all stored locally using IndexedDB.

- **Cross-Platform**: Use it on your phone or PC - wherever you're reading.

- **Quick Access**: Designed for minimal disruption to your reading flow.
