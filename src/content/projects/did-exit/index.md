Did-exit is sleek web application that extracts questions from PDF files and creates engaging quiz experiences with AI-powered analysis.

### Why did-exit ?

Picture this: It's Sunday, just 4 days before my exit exam. I hadn't cracked open a single note, buried under my final-year project and work deadlines. Panic mode!

The plan was to dive into previous years' exams and model papers from various universities. But here's the catch: They're all clunky PDFs. Some had answers tucked right after questions, but most were a nightmare of manual note-taking and endless AI searches for solutions.

I thought, "With all this AI magic happening, why not build something myself?" And just like that, in my friend's dorm over late-night brainstorming, Did-Exit was born, a sleek web app that lets you upload any exam PDF and transforms it into an interactive quiz.
