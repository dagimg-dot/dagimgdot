EthCal is a customizable Ethiopian Calendar GNOME Extension that brings the Ethiopian calendar system to your desktop's top bar.

### Why EthCal?

There was no Ethiopian calendar implementation for GNOME, leaving Ethiopian users without proper calendar support on their Linux desktops. As someone who needed to track Ethiopian dates, holidays, and cultural events, I decided to build the solution myself.

This extension provides complete Ethiopian calendar functionality with holidays, religious observances, and cultural events‚Äîall integrated seamlessly into the GNOME desktop environment.

Shout out to <a href="https://www.kenat.systems/" target="_blank">kenat</a>
! This was possible because of their npm package that provided the core Ethiopian calendar calculations.

### Key Features
