MyCaps is a simple CapsLock Emulator I built in couple of days just to give you the taste of how I use my keyboard. Maybe you don't like it, but thanks for checking it out!

### Why ?

How often do you guys use your CapsLock? Not much right. I think its in the perfect position but its not giving the functionality it should give. So what did I do as a fellow programmer? I mapped it to more useful keys. Buckle up this is gonna be hard to accept ðŸ˜‚.

### How ?

I am using Linux, specifically Fedora 40 as my daily driver for almost 4 months now. And I used custom Windows 11 for almost 1 year and half before that. I used this remap in both OSs using different softwares. On Windows I used AutoHotKey and on Linux I am using keyd. And here I want to show you what you can be capable of by remapping CapsLock to work as modifier and use it for text editing and more.
