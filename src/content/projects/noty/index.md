Noty is a minimal keyboard driven note application for GNOME. It is built with GTK4 and Python.

### Why Noty ?

I was looking for a simple note application that I can use to take notes quickly and easily. I was tired of the existing quick note applications because of the difficulty in just using them.

Many of them need you to save the notes, or ask you to save it when closing the application. I wanted something that is simple and easy to use like no hassle in saving, opening and closing note using the keyboard, create a note on the fly write what you want and it will be saved automatically.

### Key Features

- Minimalistic design
- Keyboard driven
- Easy to use
- External modification notifications
